This Streamlit application provides a toolbox for analysing physioloigcal sensor data recorded through the eDiary app.


Users can choose to
- upload a single .sqlite database file and analyze the file's content, or
- upload a .zip folder containing .sqlite database files for a field study and analyze all files at once

- an extra page is reserved for Lab Test data, which usually has either no locations, or no meaningful locations, due to the stationary setting.
